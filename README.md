# Clipboard Image for Foundry VTT

Allows copy-pasting images from clipboard into Foundry VTT Tiles Layer.

### Usage

1. Copy an Image you like from any source (internet, file or a screenshot)
2. Go to Foundry, focus on the Canvas and Press CTRL+V
3. If an Image is found in your Clipboard, it will paste the image under your mouse and switch you to the Tiles layer.

**Functionalities**

1. Images uploaded to a folder called `pasted_images` by default. This can be configured per world in the settings. If
   you would like for example to store pasted images within your specific world, then you can
   set `worlds/<my-world>/pasted_images`
2. If an image is larger than Canvas dimensions, then the Tile (not image) will be pasted as 1/3 the size of the canvas,
   while holding image proportions.
3. Use CAPS LOCK to toggle between hidden or visible paste mode
4. Faster when using small images, keep it reasonable! (large images are not an issue but rather avoid problems with slow networks and bad internet)
5. If an object is already copied from Foundry, the paste will give priority to that object ONCE

## Known Issues

If you are using **Chat Images** module, it may happen that pasting an image on the chat, if the chat panel is located somewhere
on top of the scene canvas, it might paste the image also on the scene. I could not yet find a solution for this, but
the circumstances are rare enough, it should not be an issue on a regula basis. This is due **Chat Image** disabling the focus on the chat,
when pasting, making me think that the mouse is prioritized on the scene instead of the chat.

* @vttom for an amazing helpful attitude to get this module working properly in **The Forge**

## ToDo

* More Testing
* More Configurable Options
