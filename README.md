# Window Controls for Foundry VTT

Allows pasting images from clipboard into Foundry VTT Tiles Layer

**WARNING: AVOID LARGE IMAGES!!! Larger than canvas will be resized to smaller but the inner image would still be at high resolution and can crash your instance**

**Recommended Together with [Minimal UI](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/foundryvtt-minimal-ui) and [Super Select](https://github.com/saif-ellafi/foundryvtt-super-select)**
