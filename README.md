# Clipboard Image for Foundry VTT

Allows copy-pasting images from clipboard into Foundry VTT Tiles Layer.

### Usage

1. Copy an Image you like from any source
    1. Right-Click + Copy Image (keeps original image quality)
    2. Take an Area Screenshot with Snipping Tool (SHIFT+WIN+S) or equivalent software (Makes it smaller than source, meaning lighter)
2. Go to Foundry, focus on the Canvas and Press CTRL+V
3. If an Image is found in your Clipboard, it will paste the image under your mouse and switch you to the Tiles layer.

**Note 1:** Images uploaded to a folder called `pasted_images` by default. This can be configured per world in the settings.

**Note 2:** If an image is larger than Canvas dimensions, then the Tile (not image) will be pasted as 1/3 the size of the canvas,
while holding image proportions.

**Note 3:** Should work with `The Forge` but have not tested! Feedback welcome.
