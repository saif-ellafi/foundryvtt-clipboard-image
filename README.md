# Window Controls for Foundry VTT

Allows pasting images from clipboard into Foundry VTT Tiles Layer.

### Usage
1. Copy an Image you like from the internet
   1. Right Click + Copy Image
   2. (RECOMMENDED) take an Area Screenshot with Snipping Tool or equivalent software
2. Go to Foundry, focus on the Canvas and Press CTRL+V
3. If an Image is found in your Clipboard, it will paste the image under your mouse and switch you to the Tiles layer.

**Note:** If an image is larger than Canvas dimensions, then the image will be shrinked to 1/3 the size of the canvas, while holding image proportions.

## WARNING

**AVOID LARGE IMAGES!!!** Pasting Large images will bring problems to your FoundryVTT. Try to copy small images or better, take **area screenshots** so you don't copy HD images from source. 

## Recommendation

To avoid large images and performance issues, it is better to take an area screenshot of the image you would like. For
example with Window's `Snipping Tool` or equivalent. An Area screenshout would pan the image to how you see it and thus
much smaller than the original image behind it.
